\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis a problem of state-space control of inverted pendulum was considered. For this purpose, equations describing behaviour of the plant where dervied using laws of physics. Also an experimental approach was made - a frequency response method - to obtain the model parameters. As the real control plant, a Bytronic pendulum module was used. An electronic circuit with microcontroller, for controlling the motor, measuring the cart's position and pendulum's angle, was designed and made. The control system was designed as a linear-quadratic regulator, implementing state feedback. A state observer was designed and implemented in order to obtain values of all plant's states. Effects of the design methods were successfully verified on the real inverted pendulum module.
