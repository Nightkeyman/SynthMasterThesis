\chapter*{Abstract}
Within this thesis a prototype of a musical synthesizer was made. The hardware consisted of a Lyrtech Professional Audio Development Kit (PADK) which was equipped with a Texas Instruments digital signal processor TMS320C6727. The instrument's operation was controlled using a MIDI keyboard. The following methods of sound synthesis were described and implemented: subtractive, additive, frequency modulation and physical modeling. A graphical user interface, which allows to set up the parameters of generated sound, was created on a personal computer.
