# SynthMasterThesis
Repository for Master Thesis project about Polyphonic Synthesizer Prototype &amp; Synthesis methods

## Synthesis methods we tested:
- Subtractive (Sawtooth, Triangle, Square waveforms. Filters: lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop)
- Additive (Hammond organs)
- FM (strange effects, bells, glockens)
- Physical modelling (Flute, Violin - waveguide models)

- Matlab/Octave (Simulations)
- TeXstudio (Thesis .tex files)

### Hardware
