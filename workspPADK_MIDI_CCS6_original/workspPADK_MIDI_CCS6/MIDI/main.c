// This demo shows how to perform an analog audio loopback on the PADK.
//
// The sampling rate will be set to 96 kHz and will be generated
// by one of the onboard oscillators. The sampling frequency source will 
// be configured using the module CLKGEN of the PADK library.
//
// Each ADC channel will be sent to the corresponding DAC channel:
//      ADC #1 -> DAC #1
//      ADC #2 -> DAC #2
//      ADC #3 -> DAC #3
//      ADC #4 -> DAC #4
//
// The ADC and the DAC devices will be initialized using the functions
// of the PADK library. These devices are connected to the DSP through 
// the serializers of the McASP #0. 
//      ADC #1 -> McASP0 Serializer 0 (AXR0_0)
//      ADC #2 -> McASP0 Serializer 1 (AXR0_1)
//      ADC #3 -> McASP0 Serializer 2 (AXR0_2)
//      ADC #4 -> McASP0 Serializer 3 (AXR0_3)
//      DAC #1 -> McASP0 Serializer 4 (AXR0_4)
//      DAC #2 -> McASP0 Serializer 5 (AXR0_5)
//      DAC #3 -> McASP0 Serializer 6 (AXR0_6)
//      DAC #4 -> McASP0 Serializer 10 (AXR0_10)
//
// The McASP and the dMAX will be initialized using TI's CSL library.
// The dMAX will be used to sort the input data coming from the ADCs 
// into a separate buffer for each stereo channel (left and right buffer). 
// The same organisation will be used for the DAC output data.
